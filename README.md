swapnil-indore.docker
=====================

An Ansible role that installs docker on Centos 7.x and Debian 8. I havent tested it on Ubuntu but should work.


Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: swapnil-linux.docker }
